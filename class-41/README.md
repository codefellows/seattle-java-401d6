## Feedback Review

### The Good/The Most Helpful

- Career Coaching workshops
  - hooray!

- Building out a single app for many weeks
  - Even with the difficulty of being behing, it's still worth it!
  - This is awesome!
- Instructional team
- Whiteboards in lecture

### The Mixed

- S3 work without a ton of direction
  - "pretty difficult" but "a good experience" and "getting practice for after CodeFellows"
  - "S3 wrecked us for a day"
  - All of us working together to debug was "favorite part of the week"

### The Least Helpful/ The Constructive Feedback

- Table/coworking space cleanliness
  - thanks for putting that in written feedback! Passed along.
- Daily retros
- AWS without Amplify: are you prepared?
