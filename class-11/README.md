## Feedback Review

### The Good/The Most Helpful

- Code reviews/demos
    - Michelle "tears the code apart" 😂
    - Sometimes I might go too fast/optimize it too much--please ask me to slow down!
- Labs to work through demo-like code
- The people, both your classmates and instructors

### The Bad/The Least Helpful

- Reading responses and learning journals
    - If that's the least helpful part of your day... that's kinda okay.
    - But if there are ways we can make it more useful, then that's still worth talking about!
- Some people feeling behind on labs and/or code challenges
    - It's going to be okay! I'm not seeing anyone who concerns me right now.
